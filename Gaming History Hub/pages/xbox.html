<h1>Xbox: Powering Dreams Since 2001</h1>
<p>When Microsoft entered the gaming market in 2001, many doubted the company could compete with giants like Sony and Nintendo. Yet, with bold hardware, innovative online features, and a focus on powerful experiences, Xbox carved out its place as a cornerstone of modern gaming. From the massive “Duke” controller of the original console to the sleek ecosystem of the Xbox Series X|S, the brand has continuously evolved while shaping the way we connect, play, and share.</p>

<h2>🟢 Xbox (2001)</h2>
<p>Microsoft launched the original Xbox in 2001, making a dramatic debut with the inclusion of an internal hard drive (a first for consoles) and built-in Ethernet support. These innovations laid the groundwork for Xbox Live, the online service that would redefine multiplayer gaming just a year later.</p>
<p>Despite its bulky design and steep competition from the PS2, the Xbox gained traction with landmark titles like <abbr title="Halo: Combat Evolved">Halo</abbr>, which not only sold consoles but also set the standard for first-person shooters on consoles.</p>

<h2>🟢 Xbox 360 (2005)</h2>
<p>The Xbox 360 was the true breakthrough for Microsoft. Launching a year ahead of the PS3, it captured gamers with a strong library, smooth online play, and of course, the introduction of Achievements—a feature that would influence the entire industry.</p>
<p>Xbox Live flourished on the 360, creating a digital community of millions. While the infamous “Red Ring of Death” hardware failures plagued early models, Microsoft’s support policies and aggressive software lineup (from <abbr title="Gears of War">Gears</abbr> to <abbr title="Mass Effect">ME</abbr>) cemented the 360 as one of the most beloved consoles of its generation.</p>

<h2>🟢 Xbox One (2013)</h2>
<p>The Xbox One had a rocky start. Its initial focus on being an “all-in-one entertainment device” rather than a games-first console alienated many fans. The launch reveal, centered on television integration and mandatory Kinect usage, was met with criticism and allowed Sony’s PS4 to dominate early on.</p>
<p>However, over time, Xbox One redeemed itself with consumer-friendly programs like Backward Compatibility, the rise of Xbox Game Pass, and a stronger emphasis on player choice. The system laid the foundation for Microsoft’s long-term strategy: making Xbox more of an ecosystem than just a single console.</p>

<h2>🟢 Xbox Series X|S (2020)</h2>
<p>In 2020, Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X and its smaller sibling, the Series S. With lightning-fast load times thanks to SSD technology, support for 120fps gaming, and a strong push for cloud-based play via Xbox Cloud Gaming, the new consoles represented Microsoft’s most ambitious vision yet.</p>
<p>What sets this era apart is Microsoft’s focus on services over exclusivity. With Game Pass becoming a central pillar, players gained access to a vast library spanning generations, making Xbox less about one box and more about a seamless gaming ecosystem.</p>
